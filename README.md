# g300-autoledswitcher

nothing serious, just playing around with usb and learning about by playing with my Logitech G300 Mouse I decided to make an autoledswitcher, the way it works is that it grabs the current profile and cycles through the 8 colors and setting the color byte every iteration, with a delay of 1 second. 

and I actually liked it :D.
